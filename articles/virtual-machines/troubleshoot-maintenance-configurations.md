# Troubleshoot problems with Maintenance Configurations

This article outlines common problems and errors that might arise during the deployment or use of Maintenance Configurations for scheduled patching on virtual machines (VMs), along with strategies to address them.

### A VM shuts down and is unresponsive when you use a dynamic scope in guest maintenance

#### Problem

A maintenance configuration doesn't install a scheduled patch on the VMs and gives a `ShutdownOrUnresponsive` error.

#### Resolution

It takes 12 hours to complete the cleanup process for the maintenance configuration assignment. Be sure to keep a buffer of 12 hours before you create a VM with the same name.

If you create a VM with the same name before the cleanup, Maintenance Configurations can't trigger the schedule.

### A VM shuts down and is unresponsive when you use a static scope in guest maintenance

#### Problem

A maintenance configuration doesn't install a scheduled patch on the VMs and gives a `ShutdownOrUnresponsive` error.

#### Resolution

In a static scope, it's crucial to avoid relying on outdated VM configurations. Instead, prioritize reassigning configurations after you re-create instances.

### Scheduled patching times out or fails

#### Problem

Scheduled patching fails with a `TimeOut` or `Failed` error after you move a VM by re-creating it with the same name in a different region. The portal might show the same VM twice because the previously created VM is removed from the back end.

#### Resolution

This is a known bug, and we're working on resolving it. If you encounter this problem, contact the support team for assistance.

### Scheduled patching stops working after the resource is moved

#### Problem

If you move a resource to a different resource group or subscription, scheduled patching for the resource stops working.

#### Resolution

The system currently doesn't support moving resources across resource groups or subscriptions. As a workaround, use the following steps for the resource that you want to move.

If you're using a static scope:

1. Remove the resource assignment.
1. Move the resource to a different resource group or subscription.
1. Re-create the resource assignment.

If you're using a dynamic scope:

1. Remove the resource assignment.
1. Initiate or wait for the next scheduled run. This action prompts the system to completely remove the assignment, so you can proceed with the next steps.
1. Move the resource to a different resource group or subscription.
1. Re-create the resource assignment.

If you miss any of the preceding steps, you can reassign the resource to the original assignment and repeat the steps sequentially.

### Creation of a dynamic scope fails

#### Problem

You can't create a dynamic scope because of role-based access control (RBAC).

#### Resolution

To create a dynamic scope, you must have the permission at the subscription level or at the resource group level. For more information, see the [list of permissions list for various resources](../update-manager/overview.md#permissions).

### An update is stuck and not progressing

#### Problem

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Dedicated Hosts :heavy_check_mark: VMs

If you redeploy a resource to a different cluster, and you create a pending update request by using the old cluster value, the request becomes stuck indefinitely.

#### Resolution

If the status of an operation to apply an update is closed or not found, retry after 120 hours. If the problem persists, contact the support team for assistance.

### A dedicated host is updated after a maintenance configuration is attached

#### Problem

A maintenance configuration doesn't block the update of a dedicated host, and the host is updated even after you attach a maintenance configuration.

#### Resolution

If you re-create a dedicated host with the same name, Maintenance Configurations retains the old dedicated host ID, which prevents it from blocking updates. You can resolve this problem by removing the maintenance configuration and reassigning it. If the problem persists, contact the support team for assistance.

### Patch installation fails for an invalid classification type

#### Problem

Patch installation fails because of an invalid classification type in a maintenance configuration.

A previous bug prevented the system's patch operation from performing validation, and the maintenance configuration contained an invalid classification type.

#### Resolution

The bug is fixed. Update the maintenance configuration and set the correct classification type.

### A schedule isn't triggered

#### Problem

If a resource has two maintenance configurations with the same trigger time and patch installation configuration, and both are assigned to the same VM or resource, only one maintenance configuration is triggered.

#### Resolution

Modify the start time of one of the maintenance configurations to mitigate the problem. This is a workaround to a current system limitation in which Maintenance Configurations can't identify which maintenance configuration to trigger.

### You can't create a dynamic scope for a resource group

#### Problem

Dynamic scope validation fails because of a null value in the location.

#### Resolution

This problem with dynamic scope validation causes regression in the validation process. We recommend that you provide the required set of locations for a dynamic scope at the resource group level.

### A dynamic scope isn't executed and no resources are patched

#### Problem

Dynamic scope flattening fails because of throttling, and the service can't determine which VMs are associated with the VM.

#### Resolution

Make sure that the number of subscriptions per dynamic scope is less than 30. [Learn more about the service limits of dynamic scoping](../virtual-machines/maintenance-configurations.md#service-limits).

### Configuration assignment of a dedicated host isn't cleaned up after the host's removal

#### Problem

After you delete the dedicated hosts, configuration assignments that are attached to dedicated hosts still exist.

#### Resolution

Before you delete a dedicated host, be sure to delete the maintenance configuration that's associated with it. If the dedicated host is deleted but still appears in the portal, contact the support team for assistance. Cleanup processes are currently in place for dedicated hosts, to help prevent any impact on customers.

### You can't provide multiple tag values for dynamic scopes

#### Problem

If you use the Azure portal, you can't provide multiple tag values for dynamic scopes.

#### Resolution

This feature currently isn't available in the portal. As a workaround, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to create a dynamic scope. The system accepts multiple values for tags when you use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell option.

### A maintenance configuration is triggered again with an older trigger time

#### Problem

There's a known issue in Maintenance Configurations related to the caching of old maintenance policies. If an old policy is cached, and a new instance moves the new policy processing, the old machine might trigger the schedule with the outdated start time.

#### Resolution

We recommend that you update the maintenance configuration at least 1 hour before the scheduled time. If the problem persists, contact the support team for assistance.

### A maintenance configuration times out while waiting for an ongoing update to finish on a resource

#### Problem

In rare cases, if the host update window happens to coincide with the VM guest patching window, and if the guest patching window doesn't have sufficient time to run after the host update, the system shows this error message: "Schedule timeout, waiting for an ongoing update to complete the resource." The reason is that the platform allows only one update at a time.

#### Resolution

Change the maintenance configuration schedule for the guest update for a time after the ongoing update is finished.

### Maintenance Configurations doesn't support an API

The feature currently doesn't support the following APIs:

+ Get Apply Update at Subscription Level
+ Get Apply Update at Resource Group Level
+ Get Pending Update at Subscription Level
+ Get Pending Update at Resource Group Level
