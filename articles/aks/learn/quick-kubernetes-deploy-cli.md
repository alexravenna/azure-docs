# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure CLI

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. In this quickstart, you learn to:

- Deploy an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI.
- Run a sample multi-container application with a group of microservices and web front ends simulating a retail scenario.

> [!NOTE]
> To get started with quickly provisioning an AKS cluster, this article includes steps to deploy a cluster with default settings for evaluation purposes only. Before deploying a production-ready cluster, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with our [baseline reference architecture][baseline-reference-architecture] to consider how it aligns with your business requirements.

## Before you begin

This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][kubernetes-concepts].

- [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

- This article requires version 2.0.64 or later of the Azure CLI. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed there.
- Make sure that the identity you're using to create your cluster has the appropriate minimum permissions. For more details on access and identity for AKS, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../concepts-identity.md).
- If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription ID in which the resources should be billed using the [az account set](/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) command.

## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group][azure-resource-group] is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When you create a resource group, you're prompted to specify a location. This location is the storage location of your resource group metadata and where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

Create a resource group using the [az group create][az-group-create] command.

  ```azurecli
  az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
  ```

  The following sample output resembles successful creation of the resource group:

  ```output
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup",
    "location": "eastus",
    "managedBy": null,
    "name": "myResourceGroup",
    "properties": {
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
    },
    "tags": null
  }
  ```

## Create an AKS cluster

To create an AKS cluster, use the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one node and enables a system-assigned managed identity.

  ```azurecli
  az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --node-count 1 \
    --generate-ssh-keys
  ```

  After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

  > [!NOTE]
  > When you create a new cluster, AKS automatically creates a second resource group to store the AKS resources. For more information, see [Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](../faq.md#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks)

## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl][kubectl]. `kubectl` is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell. To install `kubectl` locally, call the [az aks install-cli][az-aks-install-cli] command.

1. Configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

    ```azurecli
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
    ```

1. Verify the connection to your cluster using the [kubectl get][kubectl-get] command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.

    ```azurecli
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    The following sample output shows the single node created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is *Ready*.

    ```output
    NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
    aks-nodepool1-11853318-vmss000000   Ready    agent   2m26s   v1.27.7
    ```

## Deploy the application

To deploy the application, you use a manifest file to create all the objects required to run the [AKS Store application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo). A [Kubernetes manifest file][kubernetes-deployment] defines a cluster's desired state, such as which container images to run. The manifest includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

:::image type="content" source="media/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal/aks-store-architecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Store sample architecture." lightbox="media/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal/aks-store-architecture.png":::

- **Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.
- **Product service**: Shows product information.
- **Order service**: Places orders.
- **Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. These are used here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

1. Create a file named `aks-store-quickstart.yaml` and copy in the following manifest:

    ```yaml

      type: LoadBalancer
    ```

    For a breakdown of YAML manifest files, see [Deployments and YAML manifests](../concepts-clusters-workloads.md#deployments-and-yaml-manifests).

    If you create and save the YAML file locally, then you can upload the manifest file to your default directory in CloudShell by selecting the **Upload/Download files** button and selecting the file from your local file system.

1. Deploy the application using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.

    ```azurecli
    kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml
    ```

    The following sample output shows the deployments and services:

    ```output
    deployment.apps/rabbitmq created
    service/rabbitmq created
    deployment.apps/order-service created
    service/order-service created
    deployment.apps/product-service created
    service/product-service created
    deployment.apps/store-front created
    service/store-front created
    ```

## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

1. Check the status of the deployed pods using the [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] command. Make sure all pods are `Running` before proceeding.

    ```console
    kubectl get pods
    ```

1. Check for a public IP address for the store-front application. Monitor progress using the [kubectl get service][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument.

    ```azurecli
    kubectl get service store-front --watch
    ```

    The **EXTERNAL-IP** output for the `store-front` service initially shows as *pending*:

    ```output
    NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    store-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.100.10   <pending>     80:30025/TCP   4h4m
    ```

1. Once the **EXTERNAL-IP** address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

    The following sample output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

    ```output
    NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
    store-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.100.10   20.62.159.19   80:30025/TCP   4h5m
    ```

1. Open a web browser to the external IP address of your service to see the Azure Store app in action.

## Delete the cluster

If you don't plan on going through the [AKS tutorial][aks-tutorial], clean up unnecessary resources to avoid Azure charges. Call the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command to remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources.

  ```azurecli
  az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The AKS cluster was created with a system-assigned managed identity, which is the default identity option used in this quickstart. The platform manages this identity so you don't need to manually remove it.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and then deployed a simple multi-container application to it. This sample application is for demo purposes only and doesn't represent all the best practices for Kubernetes applications. For guidance on creating full solutions with AKS for production, see [AKS solution guidance][aks-solution-guidance].

To learn more about AKS and walk through a complete code-to-deployment example, continue to the Kubernetes cluster tutorial.
