# Networking concepts for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In a container-based, microservices approach to application development, application components work together to process their tasks. Kubernetes provides various resources enabling this cooperation:

- You can connect to and expose applications internally or externally.
- You can build highly available applications by load balancing your applications.
- You can restrict the flow of network traffic into or between pods and nodes to improve security.
- You can configure Ingress traffic for SSL/TLS termination or routing of multiple components for your more complex applications.

This article introduces the core concepts that provide networking to your applications in AKS:

- [Azure virtual networks](#azure-virtual-networks)
- [Ingress controllers](#ingress-controllers)
- [Network policies](#network-policies)

## Kubernetes networking basics

Kubernetes employs a virtual networking layer to manage access within and between your applications or their components:

- **Kubernetes nodes and virtual network**: Kubernetes nodes are connected to a virtual network. This setup enables pods (basic units of deployment in Kubernetes) to have both inbound and outbound connectivity.

- **Kube-proxy component**: kube-proxy runs on each node and is responsible for providing the necessary network features.

Regarding specific Kubernetes functionalities:

- **Load balancer**: You can use a load balancer to distribute network traffic evenly across various resources.
- **Ingress controllers**: These facilitate Layer 7 routing, which is essential for directing application traffic.
- **Egress traffic control**: Kubernetes allows you to manage and control outbound traffic from cluster nodes.
- **Network policies**: These policies enable security measures and filtering for network traffic in pods.

In the context of the Azure platform:

- Azure streamlines virtual networking for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) clusters.
- Creating a Kubernetes load balancer on Azure simultaneously sets up the corresponding Azure load balancer resource.
- As you open network ports to pods, Azure automatically configures the necessary network security group rules.
- Azure can also manage external DNS configurations for HTTP application routing as new Ingress routes are established.

## Azure virtual networks

In AKS, you can deploy a cluster that uses one of the following network models:

- ***Kubenet* networking**

  The network resources are typically created and configured as the AKS cluster is deployed.

- ***Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)* networking**

  The AKS cluster is connected to existing virtual network resources and configurations.

### Kubenet (basic) networking

The *kubenet* networking option is the default configuration for AKS cluster creation. With *kubenet*:

1. Nodes receive an IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet.
1. Pods receive an IP address from a logically different address space than the nodes' Azure virtual network subnet.
1. Network address translation (NAT) is then configured so that the pods can reach resources on the Azure virtual network.
1. The source IP address of the traffic is translated to the node's primary IP address.

Nodes use the kubenet Kubernetes plugin. You can let the Azure platform create and configure the virtual networks for you, or choose to deploy your AKS cluster into an existing virtual network subnet.

Only the nodes receive a routable IP address. The pods use NAT to communicate with other resources outside the AKS cluster. This approach reduces the number of IP addresses you need to reserve in your network space for pods to use.

> [!NOTE]
> While kubenet is the default networking option for an AKS cluster to create a virtual network and subnet, it isn't recommended for production deployments. For most production deployments, you should plan for and use Azure CNI networking due to its superior scalability and performance characteristics.

For more information, see [Configure kubenet networking for an AKS cluster][aks-configure-kubenet-networking].

### Azure CNI (advanced) networking

With Azure CNI, every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. These IP addresses must be planned in advance and unique across your network space. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front. This approach can lead to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow, so it's important to plan properly. To avoid these planning challenges, it's possible to enable the feature [Azure CNI networking for dynamic allocation of IPs and enhanced subnet support][configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation].

> [!NOTE]
> Due to Kubernetes limitations, the Resource Group name, the Virtual Network name and the subnet name must be 63 characters or less.

Unlike kubenet, traffic to endpoints in the same virtual network isn't translated (NAT) to the node's primary IP. The source address for traffic inside the virtual network is the pod IP. Traffic that's external to the virtual network still NATs to the node's primary IP.

Nodes use the [Azure CNI][cni-networking] Kubernetes plugin.

For more information, see [Configure Azure CNI for an AKS cluster][aks-configure-advanced-networking].

### Azure CNI Overlay networking

[Azure CNI Overlay][azure-cni-overlay] represents an evolution of Azure CNI, addressing scalability and planning challenges arising from the assignment of virtual network IPs to pods. Azure CNI Overlay assigns private CIDR IPs to pods. The private IPs are separate from the virtual network and can be reused across multiple clusters. Azure CNI Overlay can scale beyond the 400 node limit enforced in Kubenet clusters. Azure CNI Overlay is the recommended option for most clusters.

### Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

[Azure CNI Powered by Cilium][azure-cni-powered-by-cilium] uses [Cilium](https://cilium.io) to provide high-performance networking, observability, and network policy enforcement. It integrates natively with [Azure CNI Overlay][azure-cni-overlay] for scalable IP address management (IPAM).

Additionally, Cilium enforces network policies by default, without requiring a separate network policy engine. Azure CNI Powered by Cilium can scale beyond [Azure Network Policy Manager's limits of 250 nodes / 20-K pod][use-network-policies] by using eBPF programs and a more efficient API object structure.

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium is the recommended option for clusters that require network policy enforcement.

### Bring your own CNI

It's possible to install in AKS a non-Microsoft CNI using the [Bring your own CNI][use-byo-cni] feature.

### Compare network models

Both kubenet and Azure CNI provide network connectivity for your AKS clusters. However, there are advantages and disadvantages to each. At a high level, the following considerations apply:

- **kubenet**

  - Conserves IP address space.
  - Uses Kubernetes internal or external load balancers to reach pods from outside of the cluster.
  - You manually manage and maintain user-defined routes (UDRs).
  - Maximum of 400 nodes per cluster.
  
- **Azure CNI**

  * Pods get full virtual network connectivity and can be directly reached via their private IP address from connected networks.
  * Requires more IP address space.

| Network model | When to use |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Kubenet** | • IP address space conversation is a priority. </br> • Simple configuration. </br> • Fewer than 400 nodes per cluster. </br> • Kubernetes internal or external load balancers are sufficient for reaching pods from outside the cluster. </br> • Manually managing and maintaining user defined routes is acceptable. |
| **Azure CNI** | • Full virtual network connectivity is required for pods. </br> • Advanced AKS features (such as virtual nodes) are needed. </br> • Sufficient IP address space is available. </br> • Pod to pod and pod to virtual machine connectivity is needed. </br> • External resources need to reach pods directly. </br> • AKS network policies are required. |
| **Azure CNI Overlay** | • IP address shortage is a concern. </br> • Scaling up to 1,000 nodes and 250 pods per node is sufficient. </br> • Extra hop for pod connectivity is acceptable. </br> • Simpler network configuration. </br> • AKS egress requirements can be met. |

The following behavior differences exist between kubenet and Azure CNI:

| Capability | Kubenet | Azure CNI | Azure CNI Overlay | Azure CNI Powered by Cilium |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Deploy cluster in existing or new virtual network | Supported - UDRs manually applied | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Pod-pod connectivity | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Pod-VM connectivity; VM in the same virtual network | Works when initiated by pod | Works both ways | Works when initiated by pod | Works when initiated by pod |
| Pod-VM connectivity; VM in peered virtual network | Works when initiated by pod | Works both ways | Works when initiated by pod | Works when initiated by pod |
| On-premises access using VPN or Express Route | Works when initiated by pod | Works both ways | Works when initiated by pod | Works when initiated by pod |
| Access to resources secured by service endpoints | Supported | Supported | Supported | |
| Expose Kubernetes services using a load balancer service, App Gateway, or ingress controller | Supported | Supported | Supported| Same limitations when using Overlay mode |
| Support for Windows node pools | Not Supported | Supported | Supported | [Available only for Linux and not for Windows.][azure-cni-powered-by-cilium-limitations] |
| Default Azure DNS and Private Zones | Supported | Supported | Supported | |

For more information on Azure CNI and kubenet and to help determine which option is best for you, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS][azure-cni-aks] and [Use kubenet networking in AKS][aks-configure-kubenet-networking].

### Support scope between network models

Whatever network model you use, both kubenet and Azure CNI can be deployed in one of the following ways:

- The Azure platform can automatically create and configure the virtual network resources when you create an AKS cluster.
- You can manually create and configure the virtual network resources and attach to those resources when you create your AKS cluster.

Although capabilities like service endpoints or UDRs are supported with both kubenet and Azure CNI, the [support policies for AKS][support-policies] define what changes you can make. For example:

- If you manually create the virtual network resources for an AKS cluster, you're supported when configuring your own UDRs or service endpoints.
- If the Azure platform automatically creates the virtual network resources for your AKS cluster, you can't manually change those AKS-managed resources to configure your own UDRs or service endpoints.

## Ingress controllers

When you create a LoadBalancer-type Service, you also create an underlying Azure load balancer resource. The load balancer is configured to distribute traffic to the pods in your Service on a given port.

The *LoadBalancer* only works at layer 4. At layer 4, the Service is unaware of the actual applications, and can't make any more routing considerations.

*Ingress controllers* work at layer 7 and can use more intelligent rules to distribute application traffic. Ingress controllers typically route HTTP traffic to different applications based on the inbound URL.

### Compare ingress options

The following table lists the feature differences between the different ingress controller options:

| Feature | Application Routing addon | Application Gateway for Containers | Azure Service Mesh/Istio-based service mesh |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Ingress/Gateway controller** | NGINX ingress controller | Azure Application Gateway for Containers | Istio Ingress Gateway |
| **API** | Ingress API | Ingress API and Gateway API | Gateway API |
| **Hosting** | In-cluster | Azure hosted | In-cluster |
| **Scaling** | Autoscaling | Autoscaling | Autoscaling |
| **Load balancing** | Internal/External | External | Internal/External |
| **SSL termination** | In-cluster | Yes: Offloading and E2E SSL | In-cluster |
| **mTLS** | N/A | Yes to backend | N/A |
| **Static IP Address** | N/A | FQDN | N/A |
| **Azure Key Vault stored SSL certificates** | Yes | Yes | N/A |
| **Azure DNS integration for DNS zone management** | Yes | Yes | N/A |

The following table lists the different scenarios where you might use each ingress controller:

| Ingress option | When to use |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Managed NGINX - Application Routing addon** | • In-cluster hosted, customizable, and scalable NGINX ingress controllers. </br> • Basic load balancing and routing capabilities. </br> • Internal and external load balancer configuration. </br> • Static IP address configuration. </br> • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. </br> • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. </br> • Supports the Ingress API. |
| **Application Gateway for Containers** | • Azure hosted ingress gateway. </br> • Flexible deployment strategies managed by the controller or bring your own Application Gateway for Containers. </br> • Advanced traffic management features such as automatic retries, availability zone resiliency, mutual authentication (mTLS) to backend target, traffic splitting / weighted round robin, and autoscaling. </br> • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. </br> • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. </br> • Supports the Ingress and Gateway APIs. |
| **Istio Ingress Gateway** | • Based on Envoy, when using with Istio for a service mesh. </br> • Advanced traffic management features such as rate limiting and circuit breaking. </br> • Support for mTLS </br> • Supports the Gateway API. |

### Create an Ingress resource

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

- Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

- Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

- SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.

For more information about the application routing addon, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing.md).

### Client source IP preservation

Configure your ingress controller to preserve the client source IP on requests to containers in your AKS cluster. When your ingress controller routes a client's request to a container in your AKS cluster, the original source IP of that request is unavailable to the target container. When you enable *client source IP preservation*, the source IP for the client is available in the request header under *X-Forwarded-For*.

If you're using client source IP preservation on your ingress controller, you can't use TLS pass-through. Client source IP preservation and TLS pass-through can be used with other services, such as the *LoadBalancer* type.

To learn more about client source IP preservation, see [How client source IP preservation works for LoadBalancer Services in AKS][ip-preservation].

## Control outbound (egress) traffic

AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network and have outbound dependencies on services outside of that virtual network. These outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound (egress) Internet access, which allows the nodes and services you run to access external resources as needed. If desired, you can restrict outbound traffic.

For more information, see [Control egress traffic for cluster nodes in AKS][limit-egress].

## Network security groups

A network security group filters traffic for VMs like the AKS nodes. As you create Services, such as a *LoadBalancer*, the Azure platform automatically configures any necessary network security group rules.

You don't need to manually configure network security group rules to filter traffic for pods in an AKS cluster. You can define any required ports and forwarding as part of your Kubernetes Service manifests and let the Azure platform create or update the appropriate rules.

You can also use network policies to automatically apply traffic filter rules to pods.

For more information, see [How network security groups filter network traffic][nsg-traffic].

## Network policies

By default, all pods in an AKS cluster can send and receive traffic without limitations. For improved security, define rules that control the flow of traffic, like:

- Back-end applications are only exposed to required frontend services.
- Database components are only accessible to the application tiers that connect to them.

Network policy is a Kubernetes feature available in AKS that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You can allow or deny traffic to the pod based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. While network security groups are better for AKS nodes, network policies are a more suited, cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic for pods. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, required network policies can be automatically applied.

For more information, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][use-network-policies].

## Next steps

To get started with AKS networking, create and configure an AKS cluster with your own IP address ranges using [kubenet][aks-configure-kubenet-networking] or [Azure CNI][aks-configure-advanced-networking].
