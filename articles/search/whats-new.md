# What's new in Azure AI Search

**Azure Cognitive Search is now Azure AI Search**. Learn about the latest updates to Azure AI Search functionality, docs, and samples.

> [!NOTE]
> Preview features are announced here, but we also maintain a [preview features list](search-api-preview.md) so you can find them in one place.

## April 2024

| Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type |  Description |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| [**Storage expansion on Basic and Standard tiers**](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) | Feature |  Basic now supports up to three partitions and three replicas. Basic and Standard (S1, S2, S3) tiers have significantly more storage per partition, at the same per-partition billing rate. Extra capacity is subject to [regional availability](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#supported-regions-with-higher-storage-limits) and applies to new search services created after April 3, 2024. Currently, there's no in-place upgrade, so please create a new search service to get the extra storage. |
| [**Increased quota for vectors**](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#vector-limits-on-services-created-after-april-3-2024-in-supported-regions) | Feature | Vector quotas are also higher on new services created after April 3, 2024 in selected regions. |
| [**Built-in vector quantization, narrow vector data types, and a new `stored` property (preview)**](vector-search-how-to-configure-compression-storage.md) | Feature | This preview adds support for larger vector workloads at a lower cost through three enhancements. First, *scalar quantization* reduces vector index size in memory and on disk. Second, [narrow data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types) can be assigned to vector fields that can use them. Third, we added more flexible vector field storage options.|
| [**2024-03-01-preview Search REST API**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-03-01-preview) | API | New preview version of the Search REST APIs for the new data types, vector compression properties, and storage options. |
| [**2024-03-01-preview Management REST API**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/operation-groups?view=rest-searchmanagement-2024-03-01-preview&preserve-view=true) | API | New preview version of the Management REST APIs for control plane operations.  |
| [**2023-07-01-preview deprecation announcement**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2023-07-01-preview) | API | Deprecation announced on April 8, 2024. Retirement on July 8, 2024. This was the first REST API that offered vector search support. Newer API versions have a different vector configuration. We recommend [migrating to a newer version](search-api-migration.md) as soon as possible. |

## February 2024

| Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type |  Description |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| **New dimension limits** | Feature | For vector fields, maximum dimension limits are now `3072`, up from `2048`. |

## Service updates

[Service update announcements](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search&status=all) for Azure AI Search can be found on the Azure web site.

## Feature rename

Semantic search was renamed to [semantic ranking](semantic-search-overview.md) in November 2023 to better describe the feature, which provides L2 ranking of an existing result set.
