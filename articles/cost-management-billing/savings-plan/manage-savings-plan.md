# Manage Azure savings plans
After you buy an Azure savings plan, with sufficient permissions, you can make the following types of changes to a savings plan:
- Update savings plan scope
- Change auto-renewal settings
- View savings plan details and utilization
- Delegate savings plan RBAC roles
Except for auto-renewal, none of the changes cause a new commercial transaction or change the end date of the savings plan.

You can't make the following types of changes after purchase:
- Hourly commitment
- Term length
- Billing frequency

To learn more, visit [savings plan permissions](permission-view-manage.md).
_Permission needed to manage a savings plan is separate from subscription permission._


## Change the savings plan scope
Your hourly savings plan benefit is automatically to usage from savings plan-eligible resources that run in the savings plan's benefit scope. To learn more, visit [savings plan scopes](scope-savings-plan.md).
Changing a savings plan's benefit scope doesn't alter the savings plan's term.

To update a savings plan scope as a billing administrator:
1. Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**.
    - If you're an EA admin, in the left menu, select **Billing scopes** and then in the list of billing scopes, select one.
    - If you're an MCA billing profile owner, in the left menu, select **Billing profiles**. In the list of billing profiles, select one.
2. In the left menu, select **Products + services** > **Savings plans**. The list of savings plans for your EA enrollment or billing profile is shown.
3. Select the desired savings plan.
4. Select **Settings** > **Configuration**.
5. Change the scope.

If you purchased a savings plan, have been added to a savings plan, or have been assigned one or more savings plan RBAC roles, use the following steps to update a savings plan scope:
1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Select All Services > Savings plans to list savings plans that you have access to.
3. Select the desired savings plan.
4. Select **Settings** > **Configuration**.
5. Change the scope.

Selectable scopes must be from Enterprise offers (MS-AZR-0017P or MS-AZR-0148P),  Microsoft Customer Agreements, and Microsoft Partner Agreements.
If you are not a billing administrator and you change from shared to single scope, you may only select a subscription where you're the owner. Only subscriptions within the same billing account/profile as the savings plan can be selected. 
If all subscriptions are moved out of a management group, the scope of the savings plan is automatically changed to **Shared**.
