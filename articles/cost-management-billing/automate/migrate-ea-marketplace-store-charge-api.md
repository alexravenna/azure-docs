# Migrate from EA Marketplace Store Charge API

EA customers who were previously using the Enterprise Reporting consumption.azure.com API to [get their marketplace store charges](/rest/api/billing/enterprise/billing-enterprise-api-marketplace-storecharge) need to migrate to a replacement Azure Resource Manager API. This article helps you migrate by using the following instructions. It also explains the contract differences between the old API and the new API.

> [!NOTE]
> On May 1, 2024, Azure Enterprise Reporting APIs will be retired. [Migrate to Microsoft Cost Management APIs](migrate-ea-reporting-arm-apis-overview.md) before then.

Endpoints to migrate off:

|Endpoint|API Comments|
|---|---|
| `/v3/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/marketplacecharges` | • API method: GET <br><br> • Synchronous (non polling) <br><br> • Data format: JSON |
| `/v3/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/billingPeriods/{billingPeriod}/marketplacecharges` | • API method: GET <br><br> • Synchronous (non polling) <br><br>  • Data format: JSON |
| `/v3/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/marketplacechargesbycustomdate?startTime=2017-01-01&endTime=2017-01-10` | • API method: GET <br><br> • Synchronous (non polling) <br><br> • Data format: JSON |

## Assign permissions to a service principal to call the API

Before calling the API, you need to configure a service principal with the correct permission. You use the service principal to call the API. For more information, see [Assign permissions to Cost Management APIs](cost-management-api-permissions.md).

### Call the Marketplaces API

Use the following request URIs when calling the new Marketplaces API. All Azure and Marketplace charges are merged into a single file that is available through the new solutions. You can identify which charges are *Azure* versus *Marketplace* charges by using the `PublisherType` field that is available in the new dataset.

Your enrollment number should be used as the `billingAccountId`.

#### Supported requests

You can call the API using the following scopes:

- Department: `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/departments/{departmentId}`
- Enrollment: `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}`
- EnrollmentAccount: `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts/{enrollmentAccountId}`
- Management Group: `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroupId}`
- Subscription: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/`

For subscription, billing account, department, enrollment account, and management group scopes you can also add a billing period to the scope using `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingPeriods/{billingPeriodName}`. For example, to specify a billing period at the department scope, use `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/departments/{departmentId}/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingPeriods/{billingPeriodName}`.

[List Marketplaces](/rest/api/consumption/marketplaces/list#marketplaceslistresult)

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/marketplaces?api-version=2023-05-01
```

With optional parameters:

```http
https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/marketplaces?api-version=2023-05-01?&$filter={$filter}&$top={$top}&$skiptoken={$skiptoken}
```

#### Response body changes

>[!NOTE]
> The new response is missing the `AccountId`, `AccountOwnerId`, and `DepartmentId` fields. For account and department information, use the `AccountName` and `DepartmentName` fields.
