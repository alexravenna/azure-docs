# How to deploy Meta Llama models with Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

In this article, you learn about the Meta Llama models. You also learn how to use Azure AI Studio to deploy models from this set either as a service with pay-as you go billing or with hosted infrastructure in real-time endpoints.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Read more about the announcement of Meta Llama 3 models available now on Azure AI Model Catalog: [Microsoft Tech Community Blog](https://aka.ms/Llama3Announcement) and from [Meta Announcement Blog](https://aka.ms/meta-llama3-announcement-blog).

Meta Llama 3 models and tools are a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 8 billion to 70 billion parameters. The model family also includes fine-tuned versions optimized for dialogue use cases with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), called Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct. See the following GitHub samples to explore integrations with [LangChain](https://aka.ms/meta-llama3-langchain-sample), [LiteLLM](https://aka.ms/meta-llama3-litellm-sample), [OpenAI](https://aka.ms/meta-llama3-openai-sample) and the [Azure API](https://aka.ms/meta-llama3-azure-api-sample).

## Deploy Meta Llama models with pay-as-you-go

Certain models in the model catalog can be deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go, providing a way to consume them as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance organizations need. This deployment option doesn't require quota from your subscription.

Meta Llama 3 models are deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go through Microsoft Azure Marketplace, and they might add more terms of use and pricing.

### Azure Marketplace model offerings

# [Meta Llama 3](#tab/llama-three)

If you need to deploy a different model, [deploy it to real-time endpoints](#deploy-meta-llama-models-to-real-time-endpoints) instead.

### Prerequisites

# [Meta Llama 3](#tab/llama-three)

- An Azure subscription with a valid payment method. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [Azure AI hub resource](../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For Meta Llama 3 models, the pay-as-you-go model deployment offering is only available with AI hubs created in **East US 2** and **Sweden Central** regions.

- An [Azure AI project](../how-to/create-projects.md) in Azure AI Studio.
- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Studio. To perform the steps in this article, your user account must be assigned the __owner__ or __contributor__ role for the Azure subscription. Alternatively, your account can be assigned a custom role that has the following permissions:

    - On the Azure subscription—to subscribe the Azure AI project to the Azure Marketplace offering, once for each project, per offering:
      - `Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/agreements/offers/plans/read`
      - `Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/agreements/offers/plans/sign/action`
      - `Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/offerTypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/read`
      - `Microsoft.Marketplace/offerTypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/read`

### Create a new deployment

# [Meta Llama 3](#tab/llama-three)

To create a deployment:

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).
1. Choose the model you want to deploy from the Azure AI Studio [model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models). 

    Alternatively, you can initiate deployment by starting from your project in AI Studio. From the **Build** tab of your project, select **Deployments** > **+ Create**.

1. On the model's **Details** page, select **Deploy** and then select **Pay-as-you-go**.

1. Select the project in which you want to deploy your models. To use the pay-as-you-go model deployment offering, your workspace must belong to the **East US 2** or **Sweden Central** region.
1. On the deployment wizard, select the link to **Azure Marketplace Terms** to learn more about the terms of use. You can also select the **Marketplace offer details** tab to learn about pricing for the selected model.
1. If this is your first time deploying the model in the project, you have to subscribe your project for the particular offering (for example, Meta-Llama-3-70B) from Azure Marketplace. This step requires that your account has the Azure subscription permissions and resource group permissions listed in the prerequisites. Each project has its own subscription to the particular Azure Marketplace offering, which allows you to control and monitor spending. Select **Subscribe and Deploy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Subscribing a project to a particular Azure Marketplace offering (in this case, Meta-Llama-3-70B) requires that your account has **Contributor** or **Owner** access at the subscription level where the project is created. Alternatively, your user account can be assigned a custom role that has the Azure subscription permissions and resource group permissions listed in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1. Once you sign up the project for the particular Azure Marketplace offering, subsequent deployments of the _same_ offering in the _same_ project don't require subscribing again. Therefore, you don't need to have the subscription-level permissions for subsequent deployments. If this scenario applies to you, select **Continue to deploy**.

1. Give the deployment a name. This name becomes part of the deployment API URL. This URL must be unique in each Azure region.

1. Select **Deploy**. Wait until the deployment is ready and you're redirected to the Deployments page.

1. Select **Open in playground** to start interacting with the model.

1. You can return to the Deployments page, select the deployment, and note the endpoint's **Target** URL and the Secret **Key**, which you can use to call the deployment and generate completions.

1. You can always find the endpoint's details, URL, and access keys by navigating to the **Build** tab  and selecting **Deployments** from the Components section.

To learn about billing for Meta Llama models deployed with pay-as-you-go, see [Cost and quota considerations for Llama 3 models deployed as a service](#cost-and-quota-considerations-for-llama-models-deployed-as-a-service).

### Consume Meta Llama models as a service

# [Meta Llama 3](#tab/llama-three)

Models deployed as a service can be consumed using either the chat or the completions API, depending on the type of model you deployed.

1. On the **Build** page, select **Deployments**.

1. Find and select the deployment you created.

1. Select **Open in playground**.

1. Select **View code** and copy the **Endpoint** URL and the **Key** value.

1. Make an API request based on the type of model you deployed. 

    - For completions models, such as `Meta-Llama-3-8B`, use the [`/v1/completions`](#completions-api) API.
    - For chat models, such as `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`, use the [`/v1/chat/completions`](#chat-api) API.

    For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](#reference-for-meta-llama-models-deployed-as-a-service) section.

### Reference for Meta Llama models deployed as a service

#### Completions API

Use the method `POST` to send the request to the `/v1/completions` route:

__Request__

```rest
POST /v1/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: <DEPLOYMENT_URI>
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
Content-type: application/json
```

#### Request schema

Payload is a JSON formatted string containing the following parameters:

| Key           | Type      | Default | Description    |
|---------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `prompt`      | `string`  |  No default. This value must be specified.  | The prompt to send to the model. |
| `stream`      | `boolean` | `False`  | Streaming allows the generated tokens to be sent as data-only server-sent events whenever they become available. |
| `max_tokens`  | `integer` | `16`    | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length.  |
| `top_p`       | `float`   | `1`     | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering `top_p` or `temperature`, but not both. |
| `temperature` | `float`   | `1`     | The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values mean the model samples more broadly the distribution of tokens. Zero means greedy sampling. We recommend altering this or `top_p`, but not both. |
| `n`           | `integer` | `1`     | How many completions to generate for each prompt. <br>Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. |
| `stop`        | `array`   | `null`  | String or a list of strings containing the word where the API stops generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence.   |
| `best_of`     | `integer` | `1`     | Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the lowest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed. When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return–`best_of` must be greater than `n`. <br>Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota.|
| `logprobs` | `integer` |  `null` | A number indicating to include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens and the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 10, the API returns a list of the 10 most likely tokens. the API always returns the logprob of the sampled token, so there might be up to `logprobs`+1 elements in the response.  |
| `presence_penalty`    | `float`   | `null`  | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
| `ignore_eos`          | `boolean` | `True`  | Whether to ignore the EOS token and continue generating tokens after the EOS token is generated.  |
| `use_beam_search`     | `boolean` | `False` | Whether to use beam search instead of sampling. In such case, `best_of` must be greater than `1` and `temperature` must be `0`. |
| `stop_token_ids`      | `array`   | `null`  | List of IDs for tokens that, when generated, stop further token generation. The returned output contains the stop tokens unless the stop tokens are special tokens. |
| `skip_special_tokens` | `boolean` | `null`  | Whether to skip special tokens in the output. |

#### Example

__Body__

```json
{
    "prompt": "What's the distance to the moon?",
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "max_tokens": 512
}
```

## Deploy Meta Llama models to real-time endpoints

Apart from deploying with the pay-as-you-go managed service, you can also deploy Meta Llama models to real-time endpoints in AI Studio. When deployed to real-time endpoints, you can select all the details about the infrastructure running the model, including the virtual machines to use and the number of instances to handle the load you're expecting. Models deployed to real-time endpoints consume quota from your subscription. All the models in the Llama family can be deployed to real-time endpoints.

Users can create a new deployment in [Azure Studio](#create-a-new-deployment-in-azure-studio) and in the [Python SDK.](#create-a-new-deployment-in-python-sdk)

### Create a new deployment in Azure Studio

# [Meta Llama 3](#tab/llama-three)

Follow these steps to deploy a model such as `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` to a real-time endpoint in [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).

1. Choose the model you want to deploy from the Azure AI Studio [model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models). 

    Alternatively, you can initiate deployment by starting from your project in AI Studio. From the **Build** tab of your project, select the **Deployments** option, then select **+ Create**.

1. On the model's **Details** page, select **Deploy** and then **Real-time endpoint**.

1. On the **Deploy with Azure AI Content Safety (preview)** page, select **Skip Azure AI Content Safety** so that you can continue to deploy the model using the UI.

    > [!TIP]
    > In general, we recommend that you select **Enable Azure AI Content Safety (Recommended)** for deployment of the Meta Llama model. This deployment option is currently only supported using the Python SDK and it happens in a notebook.

1. Select **Proceed**.
1. Select the project where you want to create a deployment.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't have enough quota available in the selected project, you can use the option **I want to use shared quota and I acknowledge that this endpoint will be deleted in 168 hours**.
 
1. Select the **Virtual machine** and the **Instance count** that you want to assign to the deployment.

1. Select if you want to create this deployment as part of a new endpoint or an existing one. Endpoints can host multiple deployments while keeping resource configuration exclusive for each of them. Deployments under the same endpoint share the endpoint URI and its access keys.
 
1. Indicate if you want to enable **Inferencing data collection (preview)**.

1. Select **Deploy**. After a few moments, the endpoint's **Details** page opens up.

1. Wait for the endpoint creation and deployment to finish. This step can take a few minutes.

1. Select the **Consume** tab of the deployment to obtain code samples that can be used to consume the deployed model in your application.

# [Meta Llama 2](#tab/llama-two)

Follow these steps to deploy a model such as `Meta-Llama-2-7B-Chat` to a real-time endpoint in [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).

### Consume Meta Llama 3 models deployed to real-time endpoints

For reference about how to invoke Llama models deployed to real-time endpoints, see the model's card in the Azure AI Studio [model catalog](../how-to/model-catalog.md). Each model's card has an overview page that includes a description of the model, samples for code-based inferencing, fine-tuning, and model evaluation.

## Cost and quotas

### Cost and quota considerations for Llama models deployed as a service

Llama models deployed as a service are offered by Meta through the Azure Marketplace and integrated with Azure AI Studio for use. You can find the Azure Marketplace pricing when deploying or [fine-tuning the models](./fine-tune-model-llama.md). 

Each time a project subscribes to a given offer from the Azure Marketplace, a new resource is created to track the costs associated with its consumption. The same resource is used to track costs associated with inference and fine-tuning; however, multiple meters are available to track each scenario independently.

For more information on how to track costs, see [monitor costs for models offered throughout the Azure Marketplace](./costs-plan-manage.md#monitor-costs-for-models-offered-through-the-azure-marketplace).

:::image type="content" source="../media/cost-management/marketplace/costs-model-as-service-cost-details.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing different resources corresponding to different model offers and their associated meters."  lightbox="../media/cost-management/marketplace/costs-model-as-service-cost-details.png":::

Quota is managed per deployment. Each deployment has a rate limit of 200,000 tokens per minute and 1,000 API requests per minute. However, we currently limit one deployment per model per project. Contact Microsoft Azure Support if the current rate limits aren't sufficient for your scenarios.

### Cost and quota considerations for Llama models deployed as real-time endpoints

For deployment and inferencing of Llama models with real-time endpoints, you consume virtual machine (VM) core quota that is assigned to your subscription on a per-region basis. When you sign up for Azure AI Studio, you receive a default VM quota for several VM families available in the region. You can continue to create deployments until you reach your quota limit. Once you reach this limit, you can request a quota increase.  

## Content filtering

Models deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go are protected by Azure AI Content Safety. When deployed to real-time endpoints, you can opt out of this capability. With Azure AI content safety enabled, both the prompt and completion pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Learn more about [Azure AI Content Safety](../concepts/content-filtering.md).
