# Tutorial: Connect to a managed Spring Cloud Eureka Server in Azure Container Apps (preview)

Spring Cloud Eureka Server is a service registry that allows microservices to register themselves and discover other services. Available as an Azure Container Apps component, you can bind your container app to a Spring Cloud Eureka Server for automatic registration with the Eureka server.

In this tutorial, you learn to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Spring Cloud Eureka Java component
> * Bind your container app to Spring Cloud Eureka Java component

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial uses services that can affect your Azure bill. If you decide to follow along step-by-step, make sure you delete the resources featured in this article to avoid unexpected billing.

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you need the following items:

| Requirement  | Instructions |
|--|--|
| Azure account | An active subscription is required. If you don't have one, you [can create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). |
| Azure CLI | Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).|

## Considerations

When running in Spring Cloud Eureka Server in Azure Container Apps, be aware of the following details:

| Item | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | The Spring Cloud Eureka component runs in the same environment as the connected container app. |
| **Scaling** | The Spring Cloud Eureka canâ€™t scale. The scaling properties `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` are both set to `1`. |
| **Resources** | The container resource allocation for Spring Cloud Eureka is fixed. The number of the CPU cores is 0.5, and the memory size is 1Gi. |
| **Pricing** | The Spring Cloud Eureka billing falls under consumption-based pricing. Resources consumed by managed Java components are billed at the active/idle rates. You can delete components that are no longer in use to stop billing. |
| **Binding** | Container apps connect to a Spring Cloud Eureka component via a binding. The bindings inject configurations into container app environment variables. Once a binding is established, the container app can read the configuration values from environment variables and connect to the Spring Cloud Eureka. |

## Setup

Before you begin to work with the Spring Cloud Eureka Server, you first need to create the required resources.

Execute the following commands to create your resource group, container apps environment.

1. Create variables to support your application configuration. These values are provided for you for the purposes of this lesson.

    ```bash
    export LOCATION=eastus
    export RESOURCE_GROUP=my-services-resource-group
    export ENVIRONMENT=my-environment
    export JAVA_COMPONENT_NAME=eureka
    export APP_NAME=sample-service-eureka-client
    export IMAGE="mcr.microsoft.com/javacomponents/samples/sample-service-eureka-client:latest"
    ```

    | Variable | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `LOCATION` | The Azure region location where you create your container app and Java component. |
    | `ENVIRONMENT` | The Azure Container Apps environment name for your demo application. |
    | `RESOURCE_GROUP` | The Azure resource group name for your demo application. |
    | `JAVA_COMPONENT_NAME` | The name of the Java component created for your container app. In this case, you create a Cloud Eureka Server Java component.  |
    | `IMAGE` | The container image used in your container app. |

1. Log in to Azure with the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Create a resource group.

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
    ```

1. Create your container apps environment.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env create \
      --name $ENVIRONMENT \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --location $LOCATION
    ```

## Use the Spring Cloud Eureka Java component

Now that you have an existing environment, you can create your container app and bind it to a Java component instance of Spring Cloud Eureka.

1. Create the Spring Cloud Eureka Java component.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env java-component spring-cloud-eureka create \
      --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name $JAVA_COMPONENT_NAME
    ```

1. Update the Spring Cloud Eureka Java component configuration.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env java-component spring-cloud-eureka update \
      --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name $JAVA_COMPONENT_NAME 
      --configuration eureka.server.renewal-percent-threshold=0.85 eureka.server.eviction-interval-timer-in-ms=10000
    ```

1. Create the container app and bind to the Spring Cloud Eureka Server.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp create \
      --name $APP_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
      --image $IMAGE \
      --min-replicas 1 \
      --max-replicas 1 \
      --ingress external \
      --target-port 8080 \
      --bind $JAVA_COMPONENT_NAME \
      --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn
    ```

    This command returns the URL of your container app that consumes registers with the Eureka server component. Copy the URL to a text editor so you can use it in a coming step.

    Navigate top the `/allRegistrationStatus` route view all applications registered with the Spring Cloud Eureka Server.

    The binding injects several configurations into the application as environment variables, primarily the `eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone` property. This property indicates the internal endpoint of the Eureka Server Java component.

    The binding also injects the following properties:

    ```bash
    "eureka.client.register-with-eureka":    "true"
    "eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address":     "true"
    ```

    The `eureka.client.register-with-eureka` property is set to `true` to enforce registration with the Eureka server. This registration overwrites the local setting in `application.properties`, from the config server and so on. If you want to set it to `false`, you can overwrite it by setting an environment variable in your container app.

    The `eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address` is set to `true` due to the specific DNS resolution rule in the container app environment. Don't modify this value so you don't break the binding.

    You can also [remove a binding](spring-cloud-eureka-server-usage.md#unbind) from your application.

## Clean up resources

The resources created in this tutorial have an effect on your Azure bill. If you aren't going to use these services long-term, run the following command to remove everything created in this tutorial.

```azurecli
az group delete \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
