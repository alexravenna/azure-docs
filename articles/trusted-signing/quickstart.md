# Quickstart: Onboarding to Trusted Signing

Trusted Signing is a fully managed end to end signing service.  In this Quickstart, you create the following three Trusted Signing resources:

- Trusted Signing account
- Identity Validation
- Certificate Profile

Trusted Signing provides users with both an Azure portal and Azure CLI extension experience to create and manage their Trusted Signing resources. **Identity Validation can only be completed in the Azure portal – it can not be completed with Azure CLI.**

## Prerequisites

An existing Azure Tenant ID and Azure subscription. [Create Azure tenant](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/create-new-tenant#create-a-new-tenant-for-your-organization) and [Create Azure subscription](../cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription.md#create-a-subscription) before you begin if you don’t already have.


## Register the Trusted Signing resource provider

Before using Trusted Signing, you must first register the Trusted Signing resource provider.

**How to register**
A resource provider is a service that supplies Azure resources. Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI az provider register command to register the Trusted Signing resource provider, 'Microsoft.CodeSigning'.

# [Azure portal](#tab/registerrp-portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. From either the Azure portal search bar or under All services, select **Subscriptions**.
3. Select your **Subscription**, where you intend to create Trusted Signing resources.

4. From the list of resource providers, select **Microsoft.CodeSigning**. By default the resource provider is NotRegistered.
5. Click on the ellipsis, select **Register**.
6. The status changes to **Registered**.

:::image type="content" source="media/trusted-signing-resource-provider-registration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of trusted-signing-resource-provider-registration." lightbox="media/trusted-signing-resource-provider-registration.png":::

# [Azure CLI](#tab/registerrp-cli)

1. If you're using a local installation, login to Azure CLI using the `az login` command.  

2. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

3. When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see Use extensions with the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).

4. To see the versions of Azure CLI and dependent libraries that are installed, use the `az version` command.
•   To upgrade to the latest version, use the following command:

```bash
az upgrade [--all {false, true}]
   [--allow-preview {false, true}]
    [--yes]
```

5. To set your default subscription ID, use the `az account set -s <subscriptionId>` command.

6. You can register Trusted Signing resource provider with the command below:

```
az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.CodeSigning"
```

7. You can verify that registration is complete with the command below: 

```
az provider show --namespace "Microsoft.CodeSigning"
```

8. You can add the extension for Trusted Signing with the command below:
```
az extension add --name trustedsigning
```

## Create a Trusted Signing account

A Trusted Signing account is a logical container of identity validation and certificate profile resources.

# [Azure portal](#tab/account-portal)

The resources must be created in Azure regions where Trusted Signing is currently available. Refer to the table below for the current Azure regions with Trusted Signing resources:  

| Region                               | Region Class Fields  | Endpoint URI Value                   |

Complete the following steps to create a Trusted Signing account with Azure CLI:

1. Create a resource group using the following command (Skip this step if you plan to use an existing resource group):

```
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location EastUS
```

2. Create a unique Trusted Signing account using the following command. (See the below Certificate Profile naming constraints for naming requirements.)

```
trustedsigning create -n MyAccount -l eastus -g MyResourceGroup --sku Basic
```

Or

```
trustedsigning create -n MyAccount -l eastus -g MyResourceGroup --sku Premium
```
3. Verify your Trusted Signing account using the `trustedsigning show -g MyResourceGroup -n MyAccount` command.

>[!Note]
>If you are using older version of CLI from Trusted Signing Private Preview, your account is defaulted to Basic SKU. To use Premium either upgrade CLI to latest version or use Azure portal to create account.

**Trusted Signing account naming constraints**:

- Between 3-24 alphanumeric characters.
- Begin with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and not contain consecutive hyphens.

## Create an Identity Validation request

You can complete your own Identity Validation by filing out the request form with the information that should be included in the certificate.  Identity Validation can only be completed in the Azure portal – it can't be completed with Azure CLI.

Here are the steps to create an Identity Validation request:

1. Navigate to your new Trusted Signing account in the Azure portal.
2. Confirm you have the **Trusted Signing Identity Verifier role**.
    - To learn more about Role Based Access management (RBAC) access management, see [Assigning roles in Trusted Signing](tutorial-assign-roles.md).
3. From either the Trusted Signing account overview page or from Objects, select **Identity Validation**.
4. Select **New Identity Validation** > Public or Private.
    - Public identity validation is applicable to certificate profile types: Public Trust, Public Trust Test, VBS Enclave.
    - Private identity validation is applicable to certificate profile types: Private Trust, Private Trust CI Policy.
5. On the **New identity validation** screen, provide the following information:

| Input Fields       | Details     |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Organization Name**          | For Public Identity Validation, provide the Legal Business Entity to which the certificate will be issued. For Private Identity Validation, it defaults to your Azure Tenant Name.|
| **(Private Identity Type only) Organizational Unit**          | Enter the relevant information|
| **Website url**          | Enter the website that belongs to the Legal Business Entity.|
| **Primary Email**           | Enter the organization’s primary email address. A verification link is sent to this email address to verify it, ensure the email address can receive emails from external email addresses with links. The verification link expires in seven days.  |
| **Secondary Email**          | These email addresses must be different than the primary email address. For organizations, the domain must match the email address provided in primary email address field. ensure the email address can receive emails from external email addresses with links.|
| **Business Identifier**           |Enter a business identifier for the above Legal Business Entity.|
| **Seller ID**          | Only applicable to Microsoft Store customers. Find your Seller ID on Partner Center portal.|
| **Street, City, Country, State, Postal code**           | Enter the business address of the Legal Business Entity.|

6. **Certificate subject preview**:  The preview provides a snapshot of the information displayed in the certificate.
7. **Review and accept Trusted Signing Terms of Use**.  Terms of Use can be downloaded for review.  
8. Select the **Create** button.

### Important information for Public Identity Validation

| Requirements         | Details     |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| Onboarding           | Trusted Signing at this time can only onboard Legal Business Entities that have verifiable tax history of three or more years. |
| Accuracy             | Ensure you provide the correct information for Public Identity Validation. Any changes or typos require you to complete a new Identity Validation request and affect the associated certificates used for signing.|
| Additional documentation            | You are notified though email, if we need extra documentation to process the identity validation request. The documents can be uploaded in Azure portal. The email contains information about the file size requirements. Ensure the documents provided are latest.|
| Failed email verification            | You are required to initiate a new Identity Validation request if email verification fails.|
| Identity Validation status            | You are notified through email when there is an update to the Identity Validation status. You can also check the status in the Azure portal at any time. |
| Processing time            | Expect anywhere between 1-7 business days (or sometimes longer if we need extra documentation from you) to process your Identity Validation request.|

## Create a certificate profile  

A certificate profile resource is the logical container of the certificates that will be issued to you for signing.

# [Azure portal](#tab/certificateprofile-portal)

 To create a certificate profile in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your new trusted signing account in the Azure portal.
2. On the trusted signing account overview page or from Objects, select **Certificate Profile**.
3. On the **Certificate Profiles**, choose the certificate profile type from the pull-down menu.
    - Public identity validation is applicable to Public Trust, Public Trust Test.
    - Private identity validation is applicable to Private Trust, Private Trust CI Policy.
4. On the **Create certificate profile**, provide the following information:
•   **Certificate Profile Name**: A unique name is required. (See the below Certificate Profile naming constraints for naming requirements.)
•   **Certificate Type**: This field is autopopulated based on your selection.
•   In **Verified CN and O** pull-down menu, choose an identity validation that needs to be displayed on the certificate.
•   Include **street address**, select the box if this field must be included in the certificate.
•   Include **postal code**, select the box if this field must be included in the certificate.
•   Generated **Certificate Subject Preview** shows the preview of the certificate issued.
•   The values in remaining fields are autopopulated based on the selection in Verified CN and O.
•   Select **Create**.
